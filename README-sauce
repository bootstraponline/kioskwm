This is a fork of dwm.  It has local modifications to remove the
functionality that could be used to escape the window manager.  All
we want is basic window movement / management -- nothing else.

We've also fixed it to center windows by default.  This is better for
The android emulators.

To build, just type "make". You need to have libX11-dev and libXinerama-dev
installed.  (Unlike stock dwm, FreeType is not needed.)

This program is unable to exec other programs, and has very limited
capabilities.

The two salient window move operations: Shift-Mod1-Button1 to move a
window (also raises the clicked window), and Shift-Mod1-Button2 to resize
the clicked window.  (Mod1 is usually Alt or Meta or the Apple Command key.)
These modifers were chosen to minimize the likelihood of collision with
key strokes used by the emulator.  (Mod1 unshifted *is* used for finger swipe
emulation, for example.)
